it again to hide the section.) In the 1st column enter a command by selecting \
it. In the workbook, press \[EnterKey]. The output should be the same as the \

for GA objects like multivectors, n-vectors, and blades. For example, is a \
2-vector a vector in 2-space or is it a bivector, a grade 2 multivector? The \
vocabulary used in the palette is illustrated clearly in the spreadsheet \
named Multivector Terminology.\n\nThe 4th section of the palette contains the \
main Geometric Algebra (GA) operations. The Geometric Product can be entered \
using the first command in this section, or by using the symbol in section 2, \
or by entering either of these manually. Some resources restrict the \
Geometric Product to homogenous multivectors; that is, multivectors whose \
terms are all of the same grade. These texts then discuss \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]extensions\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], or define other \
terms, to discuss the natural extensions of geometric products to \
non-homogeneous multivectors. This Mathematica package simply uses the term \
Geometric Product to cover products of any two (or more) multivectors, \
whether or not homogeneous.\n\nThe same thing goes for Wedge, Dot, and Scalar \
products and Contractions. The user can enter homogeneous or non-homogeneous \
multivectors. The Wedge Product is computed by taking the terms of the \
Geometric Product whose grade is the sum of the grades of its factors. That \
is,\n\n\tA \[Wedge] B = [ A \[SmallCircle] B ",

experimentally verify that the simple explicit definition I use in function \
HodgeDualG satisfies this definition. The HodgeDual2G definition does NOT \
satisfy the implicit equatiocns but does have nice geometric properties and \
seems to be pretty commonly used. Hover your mouse over the palette to view \
these definitions in the tooltips.\n\nDefinitions of the remaining terms can \
either be found in the tooltips or by examining the source code which follows \
the section organization in the toolbar.\n\nThe operators in the next \
section, Multivector Support, were developed to simplify the definitions of \
the primary operators in the prior section and thus may or may not be useful \
to the user.  ExpandG and CollectG are similar to Mathematica\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Expand and Collect commands except they are basis-aware, \
able to expand and collect while handling ",
 Cell[BoxData[
  FormBox[
   RowBox[{
    SubscriptBox["e", "i"], " ", "terms"}], TraditionalForm]]],
 ". GradePpiece will pick out the grade p term(s), if any, of a multivector. \
MaxDimG will find the highest basis subscript among the terms of a \
multivector. ConstantG will pick out the constant term or terms, if any, in a \
multivector. InitializeG is used internally to reduce squares of basis \
elements. In the event that the user creates his own products, not using the \
GA operators, InitializeG can be used to reduce the squares according to the \
GA initialization specified by the user in step 1.\n\nIt is not necessary to \
revert to lists in order to perform most operations. This package allows \
straight-forward operation on the multivectors themselves using standard \
mathematical notation. However, it can be convenient to use lists for complex \
operations where one needs to keep the terms of a multivector in a particular \
order in order to operate on them. (Mathematica, as we all know, puts terms \
in its own inimitable and mostly-uncontrollable order.) Thus, the last \
section of the palette is list-related. The top two operators quickly switch \
between a multivector and its corresponding list of terms. The 2nd row \
generates two lists from a multivector. The 2nd list is a list of the \
subscripts of the blades of the multivector terms. The 1st list is a similar \
list but with the subscripts represented as e-subscripts like ",

   SubscriptBox["e",

 ". Both lists can come in handy. \n\nGradeListG generates a list of integers \
that represent the grades of the terms in a multivector. The order of the \
grades of clif matches the order of ListToClifG [clif].\n\nThe last item is a \
Signature operator that extends Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s signature \
function. Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s operator will find the signature of \
a list of, say, integers as long as they are all distinct. But, in GA we \
often as not deal with duplicate integers such as in ",

any class of items for which Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Signature \

of the number of pairwise transpositions of adjacent terms required to put \
the list in natural order. An odd number of transpositions reverses sign and \
an even number preserves the sign. It is used to determine the correct sign \

 "\n\nThis package contains only a very basic set of GA operations, but other \
GA operations can easily be built upon them. The geometric product is \
somewhat complicated to program because it must handle antisymmetrization. \
Most GA operations are easy to implement once the geometric product is \
defined. Thus, the benefits of this package are:\n\n   1. It uses natural \
mathematical notation for subscripts and standard wedge and dot symbols, not \
requiring you to learn new notation. (Both geometric product and Mathematica\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s product use a space. To distinguish them, we use a \
diamond for geometrical product.)\n   2. Operations are performed naturally, \
not by converting back and forth to lists (though lists are supported)\n   3. \
The function definitions are generally very short, self-documented, and easy \
to follow, thus easily modified or extended\n   4. The palette greatly \
simplifies typing input, entering sample multivectors that can quickly be \
edited \n   5. Because symbolic equations are handled (as well as numeric), \
it is easy to generate generic formulas and to test hypotheses such as \
whether an identity works in dimensions higher than, say, 3 or whether an \
identity can be expanded from vectors to blades or beyond.\n   6. The numeric \
capabilities allow you to instantly carry out computations that would require \
an extensive amount of time and tedium to do manually\n  7. One can quickly \
configure, or switch between, spatial dimensions, space and space-time, and \
Clifford and Grassmann.\n  8. Except for printouts (which can be pages long \
in higher dimensions) most operations compute instantly even in higher \
dimensions. The definitions are written entirely without inefficient \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]for loops\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and other such \
constructs.\n\nFinally, the author is retired and built this package working \
in a vacuum as a way of teaching himself both GA and Mathematica. If you are \
using this package, consider yourself a beta-tester. Let me know of any bugs \
you find. I might find time to correct them. I have thoroughly tested - + + + \
and somewhat tested + - - - Clifford algebras, but haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
much tested Grassmann algebras as of yet. Contact me at \
budsimrin@sbcglobal.net.\n\n\n* You can use the notebook as is or else \
implement a private notebook context. Private cell contexts have not been \
tested but are likely compatible. The problem is that the author has had to \
take great care to manage the context of the symbol e used in the basis ",
