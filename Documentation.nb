 "\nThis package was written using Mathematica version 11. The best way to \
get started is by becoming familiar with the palette. After this, additional \
examples can be found by running the file \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Examples\

implemented the steps in Quick Start.\n\nOpen a new notebook*. If the palette \

operators to examine the results. Observe that the tooltips explain how to \
enter both the subscripted e\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and the operators from the \
keyboard. If you find the operator symbols too small to see, click on a \
magnification level at the bottom of the palette. Zoom back when you wish to \
restore a smaller palette.\n\nIn the next section of the palette, Multivector \
Generators, you may need to click the triangle to expand the section. (Click \
it again to hide the section.) In the 1st column enter a command by selecting \
it. In the workbook, press \[EnterKey]. The output should be the same as the \
corresponding entry in the right-hand column of the palette. Now modify some \
parameters in the notebook, say, change the letter a to the letter b, or \
dimension 3 to dimension 4. Now select something from column 2. This \
generates the same output, but now it is provided in the input area for you \
to use, saving you from having to copy and paste the output. Finally, hoover \
over the commands in both columns to get more information. \n\nRotors are \
used to perform rotations in any number of dimensions. They are used in \
Clifford algebras and there is an example in the Examples file.\n\nThe last 2 \

numbers are the Clifford subalgebra {a + b i} with i = ",

for GA objects like multivectors, n-vectors, and blades. For example, is a \
2-vector a vector in 2-space or is it a bivector, a grade 2 multivector? The \
vocabulary used in the palette is illustrated clearly in the spreadsheet \
named Multivector Terminology.\n\nThe 4th section of the palette, Geometric \
Algebra Operations, should largely be self-explanatory except perhaps for the \
Hodge Dual. There are several conflicting definitions given in current \
literature so I have provided a couple of functions to allow the user freedom \
of choice. The equations defining the two I have chosen are shown in the \
tooltips (hover the mouse over the palette). The first definition is \
consistent with the implicit definition that the Hodge Dual is the unique \
operator that satisfies clif2 ",

and where i is the pseudoscalar. By using this package I was able to \
experimentally verify that the simple explicit definition I use in function \
HodgeDualG works. The HodgeDual2G definition does NOT satisfy the implicit \
equations but does have similarly nice geometric properties and seems to be \
pretty commonly used. \n\nThe operators in the next section, Multivector \
Support, were developed to simplify the definitions of the primary operators \
in the prior section and thus may or may not be useful to the user.  ExpandG \
and CollectG are similar to Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Expand and Collect \
commands except they are basis-aware, able to expand and collect while \
handling ",
 Cell[BoxData[
  FormBox[
   RowBox[{
    SubscriptBox["e", "i"], " ", "terms"}], TraditionalForm]]],
 ". GradePpiece will pick out the grade p component, if any, of a \
multivector. MaxDimG will find the highest basis subscript among the terms of \
a multivector. ConstantG will pick out the constant term or terms, if any, in \
a multivector. InitializeG is used internally to reduce squares of basis \
elements. In the event that the user creates his own products, not using the \
GA operators, InitializeG can be used to reduce the squares according to the \
GA initialization specified by the user in step 1.\n\nIt is not necessary to \
revert to lists in order to perform most operations. This package allows \
straight-forward operation on the multivectors themselves using standard \
mathematical notation. However, it can be convenient to use lists for complex \
operations where one needs to keep the terms of a multivector in a particular \
order in order to operate on them. (Mathematica, as we all know, puts terms \
in its own inimitable and mostly-uncontrollable order.) Thus, the last \
section of the palette is list-related. The top two operators quickly switch \
between a multivector and its corresponding list of terms. The 2nd row \
generates two lists from a multivector. The 2nd list is a list of the \
subscripts of the blades of the multivector terms. The 1st list is a similar \
list but with the subscripts represented as e-subscripts like ",

that extends Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s signature operator. Mathematica\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s operator will find the signature of a list of, say, \
integers as long as they are all distinct. But, in GA we often as not deal \

actually, that Signature G will find the signature for any class of items for \
which Mathematica\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Signature function works but I have not \
extensively tested this. Signature is a measure of the number of pairwise \
transpositions of adjacent terms required to put the list in natural order. \
An odd number of transpositions reverses signs and an even number preserves \
the sign. It is used to determine the correct signs during antisymmetrization \
operations. Thus, ",

 "\n\nThis package contains only a very basic set of GA operations, but other \
GA operations can easily be built upon them. The geometric product is \
somewhat complicated to program because it must handle antisymmetrization. \
Most GA operations are easy to implement once the geometric product is \
defined. Thus, the benefits of this package are:\n\n   1. It uses natural \
mathematical notation for subscripts and standard wedge and dot symbols, not \
requiring you to learn new notation. (Both geometric product and Mathematica\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s product use a space. To distinguish them, we use a \
diamond for geometrical product.)\n   2. Operations are performed naturally, \
not by converting back and forth to lists (though lists are supported)\n   3. \
The function definitions are generally very short, self-documented, and easy \
to follow, thus easily modified or extended\n   4. The palette greatly \
simplifies typing input, entering sample multivectors that can quickly be \
edited \n   5. Because symbolic equations are handled (as well as numeric), \
it is easy to generate generic formulas and to test hypotheses such as \
whether an identity works in dimensions higher than, say, 3 or whether an \
identity can be expanded from vectors to blades or beyond.\n   6. The numeric \
capabilities allow you to instantly carry out computations that would require \
an extensive amount of time and tedium to do manually\n  7. One can quickly \
configure, or switch between, spatial dimensions, space and space-time, and \
Clifford and Grassmann.\n  8. Except for printouts (which can be pages long \
in higher dimensions) most operations compute instantly even in higher \
dimensions. The definitions are written entirely without slow computing \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]for loops\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and other such \
constructs.\n\nFinally, the author is retired and built this package working \
in a vacuum as a way of teaching himself both GA and Mathematica. If you are \
using this package, consider yourself a beta-tester. Let me know of any bugs \
you find. I might find time to correct them. I have thoroughly tested - + + + \
and somewhat tested + - - - Clifford algebras, but haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
much tested Grassmann algebras as of yet. Contact me at \
budsimrin@sbcglobal.net.\n\n\n* You can use the notebook as is or else \
implement a private notebook context. Private cell contexts have not been \
tested are likely compatible. The problem is that the author has had to take \
great care to manage the context of the symbol e used in the basis ",
